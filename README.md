#### This repository contains CG programs that I did as part of Computer Graphics and Virtual reality course in 7th semester

We need OpenGL libraries to run these programs. Follow [this link](https://www.absingh.com/opengl/) to get the Visual Studio IDE ready to execute these graphics programs

#### List of Programs

1. Write a program to generate a circle using Bresemham's circle drawing. User can specify inputs through keyboard/Mouse.

2. Use OpenGL libraries to create two windows : display a cylinder in one window and parallelepiped in second window.
Note: Crete cylinder and parallelepiped by extruding a circle and quadrilateral respectively.
