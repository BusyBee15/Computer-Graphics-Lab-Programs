#### This repository contains CG programs that I did as part of Computer Graphics and Virtual reality course in 7th semester

We need OpenGL libraries to run these programs. Follow [this link](https://www.absingh.com/opengl/) to get the Visual Studio IDE ready to execute these graphics programs

#### List of Programs

1. Write a program to generate a circle using **Bresemham's circle drawing**. User can specify inputs through keyboard/Mouse.

2. Use OpenGL libraries to create two windows : display a cylinder in one window and parallelepiped in second window.
   <br> Note: Create **cylinder and parallelepiped** by extruding a circle and quadrilateral respectively.

3. Write a program to generate a line using **Bresenham's line drawing** technique. Consider slopes greater than one and slopes less than one. User must be able to draw as many lines and specify inputs through keyboar/mouse.

4. Write a program to recursively subdivide tetrahedron to form **3D sierpinski gasket**. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user at execution time.

5. Write a program to create a **house** like figure and perform the following operations. <br>
   &emsp; i. **Rotate** it about a given fixed point using OpenGL transformation functions. <br>
   &emsp; ii. **Reflect** it about an axis y=m\*x+c using openGL transformaion functions.

6. Design and develop a program using OpenGL to create two windows. Draw a rectangle of specified width and height by setting four colors to its corners in the first window. In the second window, draw the same **rectangle and spin** it continously. Use the double buffer concept.

7. Write a program to create a **color cube and spin** it using OpenGL transformations. The output must be adjusted suitably when the window is resized or moved to a new position.

8. Write a program to fill any given 2D polygon using **Scan-line area filling** algorithm
